## Coding Quest
Unlock Your Future, Line by Line.

## About

This project aims to ignite interest in coding among students from unrecognized communities. 
The target audience faces potential barriers to entry in the world of programming. They all 
are eager to learn, but they don’t know where to start, and that’s where we come to the rescue.

Solution:
The solution is an application called "Coding Quest" that uses gamification, exploration, and 
interactive elements to make learning to code fun and engaging. Students will embark on a coding 
adventure where they:

1. Complete coding challenges: These challenges will introduce basic coding concepts in a progressive manner.

2. Gamification elements: Virtual Classrooms for each course(ex: webdev classroom, AI classroom, etc), interactive
   websites(to read about the courses), Points, and helpbots will make it extremely easy and fun for the students to learn.

3. Interactive exploration: The app will offer an interactive world to explore, where students can use their coding skills to
   complete quests(which would be courses) and unlock new areas(where they will get new courses).


## Usage

1. We're building a mobile-first learning platform to equip individuals from underserved communities with the skills to 
launch software development careers. This initiative tackles the digital divide by providing accessible learning resources 
specifically designed for those with limited access to traditional educational resources.

2. By offering downloadable content, bite-sized modules, and visual learning tools, we cater to learners with varying schedules 
and internet connectivity.  We'll foster a supportive online community where users can connect, ask questions, and celebrate each
other's progress.

3. This program empowers individuals to bridge the gap and participate in the thriving tech industry, creating a more inclusive and
   equitable future.

Please note that the "Library" folder is excluded from this repository due to its size. It will be auto-generated when you open the project in Unity.

Also, due to file size limits, the "textures" folder within the "Assets" folder is not included in this repository. You may need to add them manually to run the project.
